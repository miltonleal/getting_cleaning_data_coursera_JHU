This repository contains files from the final project of John's Hopkins 
"Getting and Cleaning Data", available on the Coursera platform. 

### Project purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, 
work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can 
be used for later analysis.

### What the data is about?

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable 
computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop 
the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from 
the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from 
the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

### Files

- **README.md**: explains a little bit about the repo and the project

- **CodeBook.md**: explains the variables you can find in the main script

- **run_analysis.R**: it's the main script, written in R. The code downloads the 
data from the provided link, creates a folder to store all the files unzipped, 
then it downloads all the necessary files, merge them, perform basic statistical
analysis (mean and standard deviation) and spits out a tidy table containing the
means and standard deviations for each group of interest.
